// Add your global variables that store the DOM elements
const listofStudents = document.getElementsByClassName("student-list");
const pageItems = "";

console.log(listofStudents);
    const startIndex = ()
/***
   Create the `showPage` function to hide all of the items in the
   list except for the ten you want to show.

   Pro Tips:
     - Keep in mind that with a list of 54 students, the last page
       will only display four.
     - Remember that the first student has an index of 0.
     - Remember that a function `parameter` goes in the parens when
       you initially define the function, and it acts as a variable
       or a placeholder to represent the actual function `argument`
       that will be passed into the parens later when you call or
       "invoke" the function

const showPage = (list, page) => {};

/***
   Create the `appendPageLinks function` to generate, append, and add
   functionality to the pagination buttons.
